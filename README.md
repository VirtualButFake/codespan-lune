## Getting Started

This library is a port of [codespan](https://github.com/brendanzab/codespan) visually, with a different API to fit Luau better. 

Due to the current lack of a truly robust package manager for Lune, this library will be distributed without a package manager. The recommended approach is to add CodeSpan as a Git submodule to your project. A guide on how to do this can be found in the `Installation` section of the documentation.
